## 0. Pre-flight: what I verified before planning

Per the tasking gates, nothing below is assumed. Each item was checked against the working tree.

| Gate                                             | Result                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Can access remediation plan                      | ✅ Yes — `.docx`, extracted to text (452 lines, 77 KB)                    |
| Read the full file                               | ✅ Yes — all 13 sections                                                  |
| Inspected architecture / stack / routing / tests | ✅ Yes — see §0.2                                                         |
| Playwright installed and usable                  | ❌ **NO — not installed anywhere** (see §0.4)                             |
| Permission + ability to run Playwright           | ⚠️ **Not yet** — must be installed first; Docker is available and running |
| Missing pieces documented                        | ✅ §0.4 and §0.5                                                          |
| Written FABLE plan before coding                 | ✅ This document. **No application code has been modified.**              |

### 0.1 Two discrepancies that change the plan

**(a) The plan targets a different repository name.** §1 of the source says _"This is the complete remediation plan for the SHIELD062626 repository."_ We are in `SHIELD070826`. I compared the two local clones: **their tracked file trees are byte-identical in structure**, differing only in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, three `package.json` files, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and one reference doc. `package.json` in this repo is still literally `"name": "shield062626"`. **Conclusion: same codebase lineage; the plan applies here.** I proceed against `SHIELD070826`.

**(b) The plan has drifted from the code.** It was written against an older snapshot. A five-agent Fable-driven audit re-verified all 45 fixes line by line. Results:

| Status                | Count | Meaning                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `APPLIES_AS_WRITTEN`  | 29    | Defect confirmed; plan's fix is correct                                            |
| `APPLIES_BUT_DRIFTED` | 15    | Defect real, but cited file/line or root cause is wrong — fix must be re-specified |
| `ALREADY_DONE`        | 1     | B-6 — already implemented; **do not touch**                                        |

**No fix was found to be entirely inapplicable**, but several root causes in the source document are provably false. Those are corrected in §F below. Acting on the document verbatim would have produced wrong edits in at least six places.

### 0.2 Architecture as it actually exists

- **Monorepo**, pnpm workspaces. `apps/api` (Python 3.13 / FastAPI / SQLAlchemy / Alembic), `apps/web` (Next.js App Router / TypeScript / Tailwind / NextAuth), `apps/worker` (**empty — only `.gitkeep`**), `packages/` (design-system, questionnaire data).
- **Domain modules** under `apps/api/app/`: `attack/`, `csf/`, `zt/`, `risk/`, `tech_debt/` — each with `exporters.py` + pure scoring functions. `ai/` holds the single LLM egress path (`llm.py`, `engine.py`, `jobs.py`, `redact.py`). `routes/` holds the FastAPI routers.
- **AI is synchronous.** `run-ai` endpoints call `app.ai.engine.run_job` inline. There is **no Celery worker and no queue**, despite `docs/architecture.md` claiming otherwise. Redis runs in compose with **zero consumers**.
- **Compose stack:** `db` (postgres 16), `redis`, `minio` + `createbuckets`, `keycloak`, `mailhog`, `api` (uvicorn --reload, runs `alembic upgrade head` on boot), `web` (node:20, pnpm dev). Compose config validates clean.
- **Multi-tenant** via `client_id` scoping and an `X-Client-Id` header derived from the `shield_active_client_id` cookie.

### 0.3 Test baseline (measured, not assumed)

```
apps/api $ python -m pytest
480 passed in 567.51s (9m 27s)
```

**480 API tests, fully green, ~9.5 min.** This is the regression baseline. Any sprint that reduces this number without an explicit, documented reason has failed.

- **Web tests: 0.** No Jest/Vitest, no component tests.
- **CI (`ci.yml`):** three jobs — Python (ruff + black + pytest + bandit), Web (prettier + eslint + typecheck + build), Secret scan (gitleaks). **There is no e2e job.**

### 0.4 Playwright: MISSING — full statement of what is absent

This is the blocking gap the tasking asked me to document before changing anything.

| Expected                      | Actual                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@playwright/test` dependency | ❌ Absent from every `package.json`                                          |
| `playwright.config.ts`        | ❌ Does not exist anywhere in the repo                                       |
| `e2e/` specs                  | ❌ Directory contains **only `.gitkeep`**                                    |
| Browser binaries              | ❌ Never installed                                                           |
| e2e job in CI                 | ❌ Not present                                                               |
| `pnpm` on the host            | ❌ `command not found` (Node v24.15.0 is present; corepack can provide pnpm) |
| `node_modules`                | ❌ Not installed (root or `apps/web`)                                        |

The only trace of Playwright in the entire repository is an unresolved peer-dependency reference at `pnpm-lock.yaml:1565`.

**Consequence for the source plan:** every instruction of the form _"extend the s5/s7/s8 e2e spec"_, _"the axe/nav specs already provide the pattern"_, or _"the CI workflow already seeds; extend it"_ refers to **artifacts that do not exist**. The source document's §10 claim that "the suite currently reaches workspaces by `page.goto`" describes a suite that is not in this repository. Playwright must be **bootstrapped from zero**, not extended.

Per the user's explicit direction, Playwright will be installed **into the Docker stack** (not the Windows host) so tests run against `http://web:3000` on the compose network, matching CI and avoiding host toolchain drift.

### 0.5 Second blocker: no Anthropic API key

- No `.env` file exists (only `.env.example`).
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is unset in the shell environment.
- `anthropic==0.96.0` **is** importable on the host, and `anthropic>=0.40` **is** declared in `apps/api/pyproject.toml:25`.

**Therefore live AI calls cannot be executed or validated today.** The user's instruction — _"validate that the AI calls actually work"_ — is achievable in three graded layers, only the third of which needs a key:

1. **Contract tests (no key).** Prove prompt shape == parser shape by construction. This is what would have caught A-2/A-4 — the four live-mode breaks shipped precisely because fixtures were written to match the _route_, not the _prompt_.
2. **Fixture-mode e2e via Playwright (no key).** Prove the Run AI button drives a real HTTP round trip that mutates visible data.
3. **Gated live smoke test (needs key).** `SHIELD_LIVE_SMOKE=1` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → smallest real call per job. **Skipped by default; wired now, armed the moment a key is supplied.**

**Assumption recorded (per rule 9):** I build all three layers, and run layers 1–2. Layer 3 is implemented and left skipping. I will not invent, generate, or request a key.

### 0.6 Model IDs — verified, and one correction that matters

Checked against the current Claude model catalog, not from memory:

| Model     | ID                 | Context | **Max output** |
| --------- | ------------------ | ------- | -------------- |
| Opus 4.7  | `claude-opus-4-7`  | 1M      | 128K           |
| Sonnet 5  | `claude-sonnet-5`  | 1M      | 128K           |
| Haiku 4.5 | `claude-haiku-4-5` | 200K    | **64K**        |

**Correction to source §2, FIX A-5.** The document asserts the default `claude-opus-4-7` "is not a recognizable Anthropic model identifier, so the first live call after A-1 would likely 404." **This is false.** `claude-opus-4-7` is a valid, active model. The A-5 sub-fix "set the default to a valid model id" is therefore **moot as stated**. The rest of A-5 (typed configuration errors) stands.

**A load-bearing coupling the source document missed.** Section 8's Model decision routes `mitre_map` and `csf_score` to Haiku. But:

- `AnthropicProvider.complete` currently streams with a hardcoded **`max_tokens=128000`** (`app/ai/llm.py:149`), with a comment stating the full ATT&CK map is _"~65K tokens even when terse."_
- **Haiku 4.5 caps output at 64K.**

So routing `mitre_map` to Haiku **as the code stands today would either 400 on the `max_tokens` value or truncate the map mid-JSON** — reintroducing exactly the failure A-3 exists to fix. **A-3's chunking is a hard prerequisite for the Haiku decision, not a parallel nicety.** This is sequenced accordingly in §B (Sprint 1).

## F — Findings

Every fix from the source document, with its **verified** status. `→` marks a correction to the source's stated root cause. Line numbers below are the **real** ones in this tree.

### Workstream A — Make live AI actually work

| ID      | Sev      | Status    | Verified finding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------- | -------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A-1** | CRITICAL | `DRIFTED` | → **`anthropic>=0.40` is already declared** (`pyproject.toml:25`). The dependency half is done. What remains: `LLMClient.from_settings` (`llm.py:190-193`) performs **no startup import check**; the SDK import is still lazy inside `_ensure_client` (`llm.py:118`). A live-mode container that cannot import the SDK still fails at first click, not at boot.                                                                                                                                            |
| **A-2** | CRITICAL | `APPLIES` | Confirmed. Prompt (`ai/jobs.py:50-53`) demands `{"subcategories":[{"code":…}]}` — **no tier**. Route (`routes/csf.py:1083-1086`) reads `data["scores"]` keyed `f"{tier}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | {subcategory_code}"`. **A compliant live response matches zero rows.** Worse, the payload (`csf.py:1073-1076`) sends only tier strings + subcategory codes, while the prompt (`jobs.py:42-43`) claims the model receives "interview answers, evidence summaries" — **the model is asked to score from nothing.** |
| **A-3** | CRITICAL | `DRIFTED` | → **`max_tokens=4096` no longer exists.** Code now streams at `max_tokens=128000` (`llm.py:147-149`). The _symptom_ was addressed differently than the plan assumed. **But the plan's actual remedies were never built:** `AIJob` (`ai/engine.py:27-41`) has **no per-job `model` or `max_tokens`**, and **there is no chunking** — `attack.py:491-512` sends all 600+ techniques in one call (a stale comment there even describes batching that was then removed). **Blocks the Haiku decision (§0.6).** |
| **A-4** | CRITICAL | `APPLIES` | Confirmed exactly. Prompt asks for `Very Low..Very High` / `Negligible..Catastrophic` (`jobs.py:110-112`); enums are lowercase snake_case (`risk/engine.py:23-36`); `_enum_or_none` (`routes/risk.py:177-181`) returns `None` on mismatch → `likelihood`, `impact`, and code-derived `tier` all silently null.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **A-5** | HIGH     | `DRIFTED` | → **Model id `claude-opus-4-7` is VALID** (§0.6); that sub-fix is moot. → **`GET /admin/ai-status` already exists** (`routes/admin.py:642-679`, tested). **Remaining:** missing key raises a bare `RuntimeError` (`llm.py:107-111`), as does an unimplemented provider (`llm.py:176-179`) — not the typed `{reason, message}` pattern.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **A-6** | HIGH     | `APPLIES` | Confirmed, and worse than described. **Zero tests import `AnthropicProvider`.** No shared schema constant exists. `tests/conftest.py:12` forces `SHIELD_LLM_MODE=fixture` suite-wide. Critically, `tests/unit/test_csf_run_ai.py:80,109,127` register fixtures returning `{"scores":[…]}` — **the route's shape, not the prompt's** — which is the precise mechanism by which A-2 shipped green.                                                                                                           |

### Workstream C — Extraction that works and never lies

> **Correction that invalidates the source's headline claim.** The document repeatedly cites `app/ai/fixtures.py`. **That file does not exist.** Fixture logic lives in `FixtureProvider` (`ai/llm.py:65-94`), which ships with **zero** canned responses and raises `KeyError` when a purpose is unregistered (`llm.py:88-92`). A repo-wide grep for `CrowdStrike|Splunk|Okta|120000|Capability 501` in `apps/api/app` returns **zero hits**.

| **E-2** | HIGH   | `APPLIES` | Confirmed, and the test proves nothing. `invoke` uses **only `db.flush()`** — at row-create (`llm.py:235`), in the failure handler (:248), and on completion (:264). `get_db` (`db/session.py:32-38`) yields then closes with **no commit**. The failure row is discarded on rollback. `tests/unit/test_llm_client.py:94-119` calls `db.commit()` **itself** at :113 and reads back in the **same session** at :115 — a commit no production path performs.                                                                                                      |

That guard does not exist.** `routes/csf.py:350-387`does`prior version + 1` unconditionally (:357-358), identical to ZT (`zt.py:487-495`) and ATT&CK (`attack.py:252-259`). **All three need it built, not copied.** |
| **E-4** | MEDIUM | `APPLIES` | Confirmed. ZT returns `pillar_narratives`, `executive_summary`, `roadmap_summary` in the HTTP response only (`zt.py:452-458`); `ZtAssessment` has no such columns. The `mitre_map` prompt requests `executive_summary` + `top_blind_spots` (`jobs.py:96`) and `attack.py:523` consumes **only** `result.data["techniques"]` — paid for, then discarded.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **E-6** | LOW    | `APPLIES` | Confirmed. `scripts/_common.py:14-15` resolves `parents[3]`. In the container `/app/scripts/_common.py` has only three parents → **IndexError**. Compose mounts `./apps/api:/app` for api (:160) but mounts `packages/` **only for web** (:193), so the loaders' data files are absent from the image regardless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Routes are gate/generate/export/latest only (`routes/risk.py:98,184,305,376`) — **no PATCH/DELETE/lock/approve**; entries written once with `origin="ai_generated"` (:258-259). Gate at `risk.py:72-88` checks only `_latest(...) is not None`. CSF harvest threshold hardcoded `r.maturity_tier < 3` (`risk.py:147`). → **Nuance:** ZT **does** honor a per-row target (:163-164) — the fixed-threshold criticism is **CSF-specific**. |

Client-visibility gates keyed on `RELEASED`: `csf.py:410-413`, `attack.py:304-307`, `zt.py:541-544`. `RELEASED` is declared in five models but **no route ever assigns it** — the only writer is `scripts/seed_demo.py`. **The app promises clients a state no production code path can reach.**                  |

## A — Actions

Concrete code changes, restated against **verified** line numbers. Grouped by the sprint that will execute them.

### Sprint 0 — Validation harness (prerequisite; touches no application code)

- **A0-1 — Playwright in Docker.** Add a `playwright` service to `docker-compose.yml` using `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.5x-jammy`, on the compose network, `depends_on: [web, api]`, mounting `./e2e`. Base URL `http://web:3000`. Add `e2e/playwright.config.ts` (projects: chromium; `trace: "on-first-retry"`, `screenshot: "only-on-failure"`, `video: "retain-on-failure"`), `e2e/package.json`, and a smoke spec asserting the homepage renders.
- **A0-2 — Fixture-safe seeding.** Wire the existing `scripts/seed_demo.py` into a one-shot compose service so e2e has a deterministic client/admin.
- **A0-3 — CI e2e job.** Add a fourth job to `ci.yml` that brings up the stack and runs the Playwright container. Non-blocking (`continue-on-error`) for its first sprint, then made blocking.
- **A0-4 — Live-smoke scaffold.** Add `tests/live/test_live_smoke.py`, skipped unless `SHIELD_LIVE_SMOKE=1` **and** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is present.

### Sprint 1 — Trustworthy core

- **A-1** — In `LLMClient.from_settings` (`llm.py:190`), when `shield_llm_mode == "live"`, `import anthropic` eagerly and raise a typed config error naming the missing package. Add a CI step `python -c "import anthropic"` inside the built image.
- **A-2** — Create `app/ai/schemas.py` holding **one constant per job** describing the response shape. Rewrite the CSF prompt (`jobs.py:50-53`) to demand `{"scores":[{"tier","subcategory_code","governance","policy","implementation","monitoring","improvement","what_we_found"}]}`. **Ground the payload** (`csf.py:1073-1076`): include the seeded tier list, questionnaire answers (tier + notes per subcategory), and evidence flags — redacted as always. Route, prompt, and fixture all import the same constant.
- **A-3** — Add `model: str | None` and `max_tokens: int | None` to `AIJob` (`engine.py:27-41`); thread through `run_job` → `LLMClient.invoke` → `provider.complete` (replacing the `128000` hardcode at `llm.py:149`). Chunk `mitre_map` **per tactic** (~40–90 techniques/call) and `csf_score` **per tier**. Merge in the route; **apply only after every chunk parses** — one bad chunk fails the whole run loudly. Each chunk is a separate `LLMClient.invoke`, so redaction + `llm_calls` audit rows still apply per call. **Then** set `mitre_map`/`csf_score` → `claude-haiku-4-5` (with per-job `max_tokens ≤ 64000`, per X-1) and leave `tech_debt_extract`/`zt_score`/`risk_synthesize` on the env default.
- **A-4** — Fix **both sides**: state exact lowercase snake_case tokens in the prompt (`jobs.py:110-112`), and make `_enum_or_none` (`risk.py:177-181`) normalize (lower, strip, spaces→underscores) before coercing. Count nulled entries during generation; return a warning field when any enum failed.
- **B-1** — In ZT finalize (`zt.py:1073`), resolve per-capability `target_stage` from answers with engagement fallback to `ServiceRequest.zt_target_stage`, default 3 only if neither exists; pass `target_stage=…, targets=…` exactly as `zt.py:901-908`. Print the resolved target in the deliverable summary line.
- **B-2** — Mirror for CSF finalize (`csf.py:1374`) using `ServiceRequest.csf_target_tier`.
- **B-3** — Add nullable `scored_at` to `CsfDimensionScore` (**additive migration**), set whenever a human or AI writes a row; seeding leaves it `null`. Gate export (`csf.py:1153`) with a typed **409** unless every in-scope row is scored **and** the assessment is approved; the message states how many rows remain. Belt-and-braces: exporters render `"Unscored"` for a null-scored row rather than Level 1. Do **not** clear `documents_stale` (`csf.py:1262`) unless the gate passed.
- **C-1** _(re-scoped per X-5)_ — In the extract route, return a typed **422** when `parse_inventory` yields zero data rows, **before** calling the LLM. Skip the `__truncated__` sentinel wherever rows are iterated (`extract.py:172-180`). **Do not** touch fixtures — the fabrication defect is not present.
- **C-2** — Reject at upload with a typed **415** ("Legacy .xls is not supported; re-save as .xlsx"). Remove `application/vnd.ms-excel` from `artifacts.py:43`. Remove `.xls` from `TechDebtWorkspace.tsx:236`, `Dropzone.tsx:23`, `IntakeDocumentsPanel.tsx:20,26`. Wrap the parse call so `BadZipFile`/`InvalidFileException` return the same typed 422 rather than a 500.
- **G-2** — Filter `_client_tool_names` (`attack.py:405-424`) to the **latest `APPROVED`** `CapabilityList` per tech-debt service, unioned across services. When empty, return a `warning` field on run-ai and render it in the workspace before the run applies.

### Sprint 2 — Solid operations

`A-5` (typed config errors only — the model-id sub-fix is void), `A-6` (contract test per job + gated live smoke), `C-3`–`C-8`, `D-1`–`D-3`, `E-1` (session release around the provider call + client `AbortSignal` + cancel UI; timeouts already exist), `E-2` (autonomous session for `llm_calls`; fix the self-proving test), `E-3` (advisory lock + unique constraint + **build** the open-draft guard in all three routes, per X-3), `E-4`, `E-5`, `F-1`, `F-2`, `G-3`, `H-2`, `H-5`, `H-6`.

### Sprint 3 — Complete deliverables and truth

`B-4`, `B-5` (roadmap + **DOCX** answers section; XLSX Answers already exists), **`B-6` — SKIPPED, already done**, `B-7` (four sub-fixes), `D-4` (six potholes), `E-6`, `F-3`, `G-1`, `H-1`, `H-3`, `H-4` (**with the CHANGELOG claim corrected**), `H-7`, `H-8`.

---

## B — Build Plan

Sprints are small, sequenced by dependency and client-facing risk. **One sprint at a time. Lead reviews every diff before the next sprint starts.**

| **Subagent**   | Playwright QA subagent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Risks**      | Compose networking (`web:3000` vs `localhost:3000`); first `pnpm install` inside the web container is slow; browser image is ~1.5 GB. **Mitigation:** pin the Playwright image tag to the installed `@playwright/test` minor; do not touch the `web` service command. |
| **Acceptance** | `docker compose run --rm playwright` exits 0 on the smoke spec. `pytest` still reports **480 passed**. **Zero files under `apps/api/app` or `apps/web/src` are modified.**                                                                                            |

| **Risks**      | **A-3 chunking is the highest-risk change in the plan** — merge loss or double-application would corrupt an assessment. **Mitigation:** apply suggestions only after _all_ chunks parse; unit-test that the chunker covers all 633 technique codes exactly once. **B-3's migration is additive-only** (nullable column) — no backfill, no drop. **C-2 removes a MIME type** — verify no existing artifact rows depend on it.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Acceptance** | Contract test: a prompt-shaped CSF response applied through the route changes ≥1 row. Chunker test: all 633 codes covered exactly once; one bad chunk aborts the whole run. `analyze_gaps` receives a non-default target in both finalize paths, and XLSX Gap Plan row count == dashboard `total_gap_count`. Seed→export returns **409**; score-all + approve → **200**, no `"Unscored"` cells. Header-only CSV → **422**, no LLM call, no `CapabilityList` row. `.xls` upload → **415**. Draft-only capability lists → empty tool universe **+ warning**. `pytest` ≥ 480 passed. |

| **Risks**      | **E-1's session split** changes transaction boundaries around every AI call — highest regression risk in the sprint; gate on the full 480-test suite plus new concurrency tests. **E-3's advisory lock** must degrade to a no-op on SQLite (the test DB). **H-2 rate limiting** could trip the e2e suite — set limits from config and keep e2e under threshold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Acceptance** | Provider stub that sleeps past the timeout → typed **504**, no state change. Provider raises → request 500s, **and a fresh session still finds the `FAILED` `llm_calls` row**. Two concurrent run-ai calls → one 200, one typed **409**. `prod + fixture + no SHIELD_DEMO` → **refuses to boot**; `prod + fixture + SHIELD_DEMO=1` → boots. 10 rapid logins from one IP → **429 + Retry-After**. Multi-sheet, `$`-formatted xlsx extracts with costs intact and reports the sheet used. Playwright: client submits → admin replies → client clicks **from My Assessments** into the thread and reads it (no `page.goto`). Playwright: fresh admin session picks a client **via the UI switcher** and reaches Risk Register. |

## L — Live Validation

How each class of fix is proven. **Green fixture tests prove nothing about live mode** — that lesson is the origin of A-2, A-4, and A-6, and it governs this section.

### L.1 Playwright — bootstrapped, then used

**Access verification (gate, Sprint 0).** Before writing a single spec: `docker compose run --rm playwright npx playwright --version`. If that fails, `BLOCKED.md` is written and implementation stops.

**Runtime.** App started via `docker compose up -d db redis minio createbuckets api web`; tests execute **inside the compose network** against `http://web:3000`. No host `pnpm` needed. Traces on first retry, screenshots on failure, video retained on failure — all written to `e2e/test-results/` and cited in Evidence.

**Flows validated, mapped to fixes:**

| Spec                           | Proves                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `smoke.spec.ts`                | Harness works (Sprint 0)                                                        |
| `extraction-errors.spec.ts`    | C-1 (empty CSV → error pill, no data), C-2 (.xls → typed message)               |
| `playbook-export-gate.spec.ts` | B-3 (seed → export blocked; score + approve → allowed)                          |
| `client-thread.spec.ts`        | D-1 (submit → admin reply → client clicks **from My Assessments** and reads it) |
| `admin-switcher.spec.ts`       | D-2 (fresh session, pick client **via UI**, reach Risk Register)                |
| `fixture-badge.spec.ts`        | E-5 (every AI suggestion carries a "simulated" badge)                           |
| `risk-governance.spec.ts`      | F-3 (edit → lock → regenerate → approve → export)                               |

Note: the existing suite's habit of `page.goto` with API-resolved ids is exactly why D-1 and D-2 were invisible. **New specs click the real path.**

### L.2 Unit tests (pytest)

- **Contract tests (A-6) — the highest-leverage addition.** One schema constant per job in `ai/schemas.py`; the prompt text references it, the route validates against it, and a test generates a schema-conformant response and asserts the route applies it. Deliberately breaking a prompt shape locally **must** fail CI.
- **Export-content tests (B-1…B-7).** Open the generated XLSX/DOCX and compare numbers to engine output **for non-default targets**. Today the suite asserts only HTTP 200 + content-type on downloads — precisely why the target-mismatch defects survived a green suite.
- **Parser tests (C-3).** `parsers.py` has **zero** direct tests. Add multi-sheet, duplicate-header, ragged-row, BOM, 500-row-cap, sentinel-row, and binary-garbage cases.
- **Concurrency tests (E-3).** Two threads, one 409.
- **Audit-durability test (E-2).** Provider raises → request 500s → **a fresh session** finds the `FAILED` row. The current test commits by hand in the same session and therefore proves nothing; it will be rewritten.

### L.3 Live AI validation — the three layers

1. **Structural (no key).** Contract tests prove prompt/parser agreement. This is the layer that would have caught all four live-mode breaks.
2. **Behavioral (no key).** Playwright drives Run AI in fixture mode; asserts a real HTTP round trip mutated visible data and wrote an `llm_calls` row.
3. **Live (key required).** `tests/live/test_live_smoke.py`, `@pytest.mark.skipif(not (SHIELD_LIVE_SMOKE and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY))`. Smallest real call per job; asserts a parseable response and a committed `llm_calls` row, including on a forced failure.

**Layer 3 will report SKIPPED until a key is provided.** I will state that plainly in Evidence rather than implying live coverage.

### L.4 Lint / typecheck / build

Per sprint, matching CI exactly: `ruff` + `black --check` + `bandit` (api); `prettier --check` + `eslint` + `tsc --noEmit` + `next build` (web); `gitleaks`. Web checks run **inside the container** (no host `pnpm`).

### L.5 Manual review (lead)

Reserved for judgment the tests cannot make: prompt wording (A-2, A-4), the resolved-target line printed into deliverables (B-1/B-2), banner and badge copy (E-5), and every documentation claim in H-1/H-4 — read against the code, not against the previous doc.

### Sprint 0 — Validation Harness ✅ PASS

**Executed 2026-07-09. Lead reviewed the diff before recording this.**

**What changed.** Playwright bootstrapped from zero and proven against the composed stack. A test-only `playwright` service added to `docker-compose.yml` under a `test` profile. An e2e CI job added (non-blocking for one sprint). An env-gated live-smoke test added, skipped by default. **No file under `apps/api/app/` or `apps/web/src/` was touched.**

**Subagent.** None — the lead executed this directly. The bootstrap is a small, delicate infra change on the critical path, and the tasking's own rule ("do not let subagents make broad, unrelated changes") argued against delegating a change that spans compose, CI, and pytest config.

**Files changed (6 added, 2 modified):**

| **Negative control** | same, with `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://web:9999`    | **3 failed, EXIT=1** — harness provably detects breakage |

The negative control matters: a suite that has never failed is not evidence of anything. Pointing it at a dead port produced 3 failures, a non-zero exit, and full artifacts.

**Artifacts.** `e2e/test-results/` produced 19 files on the host via the bind mount, including `trace.zip`, `test-failed-1.png`, and `video.webm`. Confirmed excluded from git by `.gitignore:51` (`git check-ignore -v` verified). CI uploads them via `actions/upload-artifact`.

**Environment facts established.**

- Playwright image: `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.61.1-noble`, 2.8 GB, bundles Playwright **1.61.1** and `chromium-1129`.
- App under test: Next.js 14.2.15, ready in 2.4 s; `GET /health` → `{"status":"ok","version":"0.1.0"}`.
- `seed_demo.py` resolves its root via `parents[1]` and therefore **works inside the container** — only `_common.py` uses the broken `parents[3]`. FIX E-6 is real but does **not** block the CI e2e seed step.

**Pass/fail: PASS.**

**Remaining issues / follow-ups.**

1. **Version pin is a coupled pair.** The image tag and `@playwright/test` must move together or the run dies with `Executable doesn't exist at /ms-playwright/chromium-1129`. My first draft used a floating `^1.49.1` against an image shipping 1.61.1 — caught before commit, comment added in `docker-compose.yml`. **Do not "helpfully" widen that constraint.**
2. **CI will pay a ~2.8 GB image pull per run.** Non-blocking today. Before flipping `continue-on-error: false` at the Sprint 1 exit, cache the image layer (or move to a slimmer variant).
3. **`.gitignore` already carried a Playwright section** before this sprint (`test-results/`, `playwright-report/`, `playwright/.cache/`). Someone scaffolded the intent; the harness never landed. Nothing to add.
4. **Live smoke remains SKIPPED** — no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` present. Per the recorded decision, it is scaffolded and arms automatically the moment a key is supplied. **No live Claude call has been made, and none is claimed.**

## Assumptions and decisions recorded (rule 9)

2. **`claude-opus-4-7` is valid.** A-5's model-id sub-fix is void; the typed-error sub-fix proceeds.
3. **A-3 gates the Haiku split** (X-1). Chunking lands first; per-job `max_tokens ≤ 64000` for Haiku jobs.
4. **B-6 is skipped** — already implemented. Rewriting it would be a pure regression risk.
5. **C-1 is re-scoped** — the fabrication fixture does not exist. Only the sentinel-row and zero-row-guard defects are fixed.
6. **E-3 builds the open-draft guard in all three routes**; CSF has none to copy.
7. **H-4's CHANGELOG claim is corrected** — no duplicate `[3.0.0]`; the real defect is three `[Unreleased]` variants.
8. **Playwright runs in Docker**, per the user's direction, against `http://web:3000`.
9. **Live AI validation is scaffolded but skipped** pending `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. No key will be invented or requested from a third party.
10. **No secrets, `.env` files, production config, or deployment config will be modified.** The `docker-compose.yml` change in Sprint 0 adds a **test-only service** and touches no existing service definition.
